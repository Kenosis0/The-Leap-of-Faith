## ✨ A Tale of Light, Hope, and the Reach for Freedom

Deep within a dusty, abandoned basement, a lonely desk lamp named **Lumen** awakens. His light flickers to life, illuminating the forgotten corners of a decaying workshop. But something catches his eye—a faint, golden glow in the distance.

**A firefly**, trapped inside a glass jar, pulses with desperate light across a dangerous gap.

Lumen must act.

## 🎬 The Story Unfolds

Experience a heartfelt interactive animation that captures the essence of determination against all odds:

### 🌅 The Awakening
Lumen stirs from slumber, clicking his own light on. With a gentle stretch, he reveals himself not as a mere object—but as a character with soul.

### ⚡ The Anticipation  
Spotting the trapped firefly, Lumen coils himself like a spring. Squash and stretch. The tension builds. The firefly's glow pulses faster, sensing hope approaches.

### 🚀 The Leap of Faith
With everything he has, Lumen launches himself toward his goal. His body stretches mid-air, power cord trailing behind in a graceful arc of motion.

### 💥 The Snap
Reality strikes. The cord reaches its limit. Lumen jerks backward violently—his lamp shade whipping from the sudden halt. The world shakes. His light flashes a stressed orange.

### 🥀 The Settle
Pulled back by his own tether, Lumen crashes down with a heavy thud. His light flickers weakly—exhausted, disappointed. In one final, charming moment, his shade droops over his "eyes," a clumsy yet endearing defeat.
